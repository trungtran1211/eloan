            <h1>Rates and Fees</h1>
            <p>bestusapayday.com streamlines the loan process from start to finish, though we do not lend you money
                ourselves. This also means we do not make any decisions on your request, we cannot influence the
                lender’s decision, and we are not privy to information regarding your fees, rates, APR, nonpayment
                rules, and renewal policy.</p>
            <p>This website is an online service that works to put in touch borrowers like you with reliable lenders
                that are ready to satisfy your current financial needs.</p>
            <p>All details, such as fees, rates, APR, nonpayment rules, and renewal policy are specified in your loan
                agreement and depend on local regulations by state. On our part we provide plenty of information that
                can help you better understand what a loan is, how it works, and how to use it wisely.</p>
            <p>The service works for you for free. We do not bring you to accept the first available offer, allowing you
                to decline unsuitable options for as long as you are completely satisfied with all terms and conditions.
                Our activity has a simple goal: meeting our clients’ financial interests. That's just how it has to be.
            </p>
            <p>Once your request is approved, the lender will make you an offer, including the fees and APR, as well as
                the terms of repayment and loan renewal options, if any. We encourage you to read the agreement
                carefully and weigh all pros and cons and be fully equipped with the necessary information to not fall
                in an unpleasant financial situation.</p>
            <p>Pay particular attention to non-payments that may result in additional fees, negative impact on your
                credit score, and even collection activities. In case you have no funds to repay the debt on a due date,
                immediately contact your lender and discuss ways how to handle the situation.</p>
            <p>Some lenders can offer to resort to a loan renewal. Remember that each lender has its own renewal policy,
                so we recommend that you peruse it before accepting the offer.</p>
            <p>If you need more information on your loan agreement, please address all your questions directly to your
                lender. As far as we are concerned, we are ready to answer only those questions that are relevant to our
                service.</p>
            <p>Disclosures described above are for information purposes only. Do not regard them as legal advice.</p>

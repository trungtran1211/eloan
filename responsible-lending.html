            <h1>Responsible Lending</h1>
            <div>
                <p>We at bestusapayday.com do our best to protect you against unfair lending practices. In order to achieve
                    this goal as effectively as possible, we resort to the following actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We supply you with significant information about the current state of loan industry, details
                        concerning responsible lending and the consequences of non-payments or missed payments;</li>
                    <li>We cover these issues in a clear way so you can easily understand important details;</li>
                    <li>We treat every customer with respect adhering to transparent relationships;</li>
                    <li>We apply energy to provide a high-quality service and support;</li>
                    <li>We demand from our partners to abide by Fair Lending practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Lending Partners</h3>
                <p>We work only with those lenders who abide by law and are legally authorized to lend money to
                    consumers. We take every effort to build a network of only reliable partners to ensure that you, our
                    customer, get the services of high quality and risk nothing.</p>
                <p>Once you are connected with a financial provider, please check details on that lender so you can ask
                    them questions if any occur.</p>
                <p>It’s important to remember that every lender has their own terms and conditions. Interest rates,
                    repayments, late payments, missed payments, and loan renewals vary by lender. To know what to
                    expect, contact your financial provider.</p>
                <h3>Impact on Credit Score</h3>
                <p>Information on your financial background is translated into a three-digit score that serves to
                    express your credit worthiness and predict how likely you are to handle the debt in the future. The
                    higher your score, the more chances you have to be approved for a loan with better terms. Things
                    that may negatively affect your credit score are listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>late payments,</li>
                    <li>missed payments,</li>
                    <li>hard credit check,</li>
                    <li>loan renewal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, if your credit is less than perfect you still can be approved. All loans are subject to
                    credit approval.</p>
                <h3>Late Payments</h3>
                <p>We strongly recommend that you have a responsible attitude to borrowing and take a loan only when you
                    can afford it. It is important to understand the consequences of making late payments. If you make a
                    late payment, you’ll have to pay a fee. We do not possess information on the amount of penalty. It
                    only becomes available when a financial provider reaches you to finalize the loan process.</p>
                <p>Always review all the documentation before signing the loan agreement to understand any potential
                    fees that may result from late payment.</p>
                <p>If you feel that you can’t repay on time, get in touch with your lender as soon as possible and warn
                    them about your situation.</p>
                <p>Please remember that a personal loan is a short-time solution and should not be seen as a tool to
                    cope with major financial struggles.</p>
                <h3>Missing a Payment</h3>
                <p>We encourage borrowers to pay off their debt on time. Missing a payment may result in additional fees
                    and collection activities which may negatively affect your credit score. Each lender has their own
                    policy regarding missed payments. We recommend that you thoroughly peruse your loan agreement as it
                    contains all the significant information about lender’s policy towards missed payments.</p>
                <p>If you aren’t able to able to repay the loan on the due date, please contact your provider in advance
                    to settle the issue.</p>
                <h3>Rollovers</h3>
                <p>Some financial providers offer the opportunity to roll your debt over if you are unable to repay on
                    the due date. Note that renewing a loan is not free: you have to pay a fee to delay the repayment.
                    The fee does not reduce the amount you owe and the rollover payments have the same interest rate as
                    the missed payment.</p>
                <h2>Types of Renewal Policies</h2>
                <p>We work with a considerable number of lenders, and each of them has their own renewal policy.
                    Typically, they offer two types of renewals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unlimited renewals. They allow you to renew your debt on numerous occasions and are very
                        expensive decisions.</li>
                    <li>Automatic and borrower-initiated renewals. They allow you to renew your debt but on a limited
                        basis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Collection</h3>
                <p>In extreme cases when you have a delinquent payment and are reluctant to contact your lender to
                    discuss the issue, they can resort to collection activities. Typically, they inform you about the
                    intention to begin the collection procedure by phone, mail or email. If you still avoid
                    communication, your lender may turn to a collection agency.</p>
                <p>The collection practices of a particular lender are stated in the loan agreement. We encourage
                    borrowers to read it carefully to be aware of the lender’s policy regarding the collection
                    practices. For more information, please get in touch with your lender.</p>

            <p><strong>We address your privacy with care.</strong> We understand the importance of personal data safety.
                And
                we are also well aware of the pressure the modern world puts upon management of this information. To
                make
                our privacy protection principles clear, we established this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read
                this
                section before you start using bestusapayday.com.</p>
            <p>Please note that by using our platform you confirm that you agree with our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3>1. What Kind of Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We gather the following information from you, personally identifiable information and non-personally
                identifiable information.</p>
            <p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong> is the sort of data that allows to recognize you as
                an
                individual. You provide us with it when you sign up and start submitting a request. This information may
                include but is not limited to: your full name, date of birth, place of residence, phone and mobile phone
                number, driver’s license, social security number, relevant employment details, income, banking account,
                credit history, military status.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-personally identifiable information</strong> relates to the data that doesn’t reveal anything
                about your identity. This information is anonymous and may include but is not limited to: IP address,
                Internet provider, browser, language, time of browsing session, clicks, links you followed, etc. Such
                kind
                of data is collected through cookies, web beacons and pixel tags.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong> are tiny pieces of data sent by a website you visited and stored at your
                computer.
            </p>
            <p>The terms of <strong>web beacons</strong> and <strong>pixel tags</strong> are associated with small
                transparent graphic images that allow to track behavior of website visitors.</p>
            <h3>2. Why We Collect This Information</h3>
            <p>Collecting personal details of users is necessary for business management, technical support improvement
                and
                marketing research. We also need your private data to process your application and get you connected
                with
                one of our lenders.</p>
            <h3>3. How We Share Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>By providing your personally identifiable information, you allow us to process your application and
                connect
                you with a lender. That also means that we have the right to share this information with a third party
                because a lender cannot approve your loan without knowing anything about you.</p>
            <p>Please note that lenders may verify your personal information by sending requests to national databases
                and
                credit reporting agencies. Such inquiries may affect your credit score.</p>
            <p>We may share some of your data with our affiliates, partners and other accredited third parties for the
                purposes of business management, security, advertising, marketing, consumer behavior research, consumer
                support improvement.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to share your information with another company that has acquired our business, a
                part of
                it, or fused with us. In case such a situation takes place, it’s possible that we will inform you about
                these changes by email or with an announcement posted on our website.</p>
            <p>We may share your personally identifiable information if it is required by the law and is necessary to
                proceed with a legal process or to protect our rights.</p>
            <h3>4. How We Share Your Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>By collecting and sharing your non-personally identifiable information with third parties, we improve our
                technical service, analyze the behavior of our customers and gather web statistics important to
                management
                of our business. We may share it with other third parties for these purposes.</p>
            <h3>5. Links Provided by Third Parties</h3>
            <p>When browsing our website, you may come upon links to third parties’ websites. All these links are given
                to
                you only as a reference. You click them on your own will. We do not manage those websites; therefore, we
                cannot be held accountable for their content, privacy policy, terms and practices as their management is
                beyond our responsibility and control.</p>
            <h3>6. Marketing Practices</h3>
            <p>By accessing our website, you acknowledge that you know about our marketing practices and agree with
                them.
                You have nothing against receiving advertisements, newsletters, marketing messages and other promotional
                materials from us.</p>
            <p>Our third-party partners may also send you their marketing messages using all the contacts you’ve
                provided us
                with.</p>
            <p>When you start using our website, you acknowledge that you are aware of our marketing practices and that
                you
                agree to receive such kind of messages from us and our third-party partners. In case you don’t want to
                receive marketing messages from us, we give you an option to opt-out. Nevertheless, if you want to
                opt-out
                from third parties’ messages, you should contact them directly with this request.</p>
            <p>Please note, that we are not responsible for marketing practices of third parties as we do not control
                them.
            </p>
            <h3>7. How We Protect Your Information</h3>
            <p>To keep your personal information safe, we use safeguards and advanced security systems that correspond
                to
                the US law requirements regarding this matter. Only authorized personnel can access your data. They may
                do
                so only for business purposes allowed by the current US legislation.</p>
            <p>Despite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee total safety of your data. This is impossible due to the
                fact
                that we are not able to control law violators.</p>
            <h3>8. Notice for Foreigners</h3>
            <p>We render our services exclusively to employed residents of the United States. If you are a foreigner,
                don’t
                access our website.</p>
            <h3>9. Notice for Minors</h3>
            <p>We render our services exclusively to people over 18 years old. If you are a minor, don’t access our
                website.
            </p>
            <p>As seen above, we do not deliberately collect data from children. If you are a parent or a legal guardian
                of
                a child that accessed our website, please, inform us about the incident using our contacts.</p>
            <h3>10. Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to revise, modify, update this Privacy Policy when we find appropriate to do so. We
                can
                revise, modify, update the Privacy Policy without notice. For this reason we encourage you to reread
                this
                section from time to time. If you keep accessing our website after we’ve changed the Privacy Policy,
                then it
                will mean that you agree with the changes.</p>
